# Scenes

If you create a scene that you'd like to be a part of the final game, go to /Assets/Scripts/SceneManagement/SceneManifest.cs and follow the instructions there on how to add a scene to the game.

Once you're done with that, also add your scene to the build settings by going to File>Build Settings and dragging your scene into the "Scenes in Build" area.
