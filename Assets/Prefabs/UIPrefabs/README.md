**ToCreditsButton**, **ToLevelButton**, and **ToTitleButton** are buttons that transition to the credits, a test level, and the title screen respectively.  By editing the Scene parameter on the *Scene Transition* Button component, you can modify the destination scene.  You can also modify the text by changing the *TextMeshPro - Text (UI)* component in the child GameObject.
